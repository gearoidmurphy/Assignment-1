# Beiginning Workshop's 15/03/2019
We started the workshops today they are composed of building a circuit on a breadboard and connecting it to our raspberry pi and then using phyton to code it.
## Workshop 1
### Programing on Phyton
we used a nano editer to code in workshop 1 we had a simple enough piece of code which we made it returen hello world
(add picture of code later)

## Workshop 2
### Building the circuit
we where given a kit which contained a breadboard, wires and other conponents.
we then assembled the circiut show in the instructions and then conected to the raspberry pi at pins 6,13,14

### Programing on Phyton
In this code we made the LED light and it print a message of "LED ON" and "LED OFF"

## Workshop 3
### Building the circuit
we where given a kit which contained a breadboard, wires and other conponents.
we then assembled the circiut show in the instructions and then conected to the raspberry pi at pins 6,13,14

### Programing on Phyton
In this code we had make a LED blink in a certian sequence to create an SOS effect through the light

## Workshop 4 
### Building the circuit
we where given a kit which contained a breadboard, wires and other conponents.
we then assembled the circiut show in the instructions and then conected to the raspberry pi at pins 6,13,14

### Programing on Phyton
In this code we had make a LED that lit up every time the button was pressed
